ABCL Examples Building and Running Instructions
===============================================

To compile 

    cmd$ javac  -cp ../../dist/abcl.jar  Main.java

where the "../../../dist/abcl.jar" represents the path to your
abcl.jar file, which is built via the Ant based build.  This path
could be slightly different depending on how the system was
constructed, and possibly due to operating system conventions for
specifying relative paths.  However you resolve this locally, we'll
refer to this as '$ABCL_ROOT/dist/abcl.jar' for the rest of these
instructions.

This compiles the Java source file "Main.java" into a JVM runtime or
class file named "Main.class".

To run the example (Main.class for example) from a Unix-like OS use:

    cmd$ export CLASSPATH=.
    cmd$ $ABCL_ROOT/abcl

then, in abcl repl, use:
(load "lispfunctions")
(void-function)

or in Windows use:

    cmd$  set CLASSPATH=.
    cmd$  $ABCL_ROOT/abcl

then, in abcl repl, use:
(load "lispfunctions")
(void-function)

This will result in the Main class being found from the CLASSPATH, and you
can invoke the functions of the Main class from lisp code.
