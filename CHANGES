08-OCT-2016

Enhancements
============

* Consolidated RUN-PROGRAM fixes (ferada, pipping)

  In support of getting a more universal UIOP:RUN-PROGAM across all
  contemporary Lisp implementations.

* Upstream consolidated patchset (ferada)

** [r14857] Support `FILE-POSITION` on string streams.
** [r14859] Add multiple disassembler selector.
** [r14860] Add EXTERNAL-ONLY option to APROPOS.

Version 1.3.3
=============
http://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.3.3/
18-SEP-2015

Enhancements
------------

*  [r14802,r14813] Add character name for non-breaking space

   Use a human readable name for character 160, #\No-break_space,
   following sbcl, ccl and clisp. This permits the Quicklisp system
   spinneret to load.  The #\No-break_space name is a valid
   CHAR-NAME/NAME-CHAR pair, but is not emitted as a glyph under the
   current output encoding under the CL:FORMAT "~:c" directive as
   these implementations do by default.

   Thanks to Javier Olaechea.

Fixes
-----

* [r14808] CL:FILE-WRITE-DATE fixed for logical pathnames

  Fix COMPILE-SYSTEM to offer full ANSI environment for ASDF and
  ABCL-CONTRIB. 

* ABCL-ASDF

** Use of Maven has been robustified.

   Addresses <http://abcl.org/trac/ticket/390>.

*** [r14806] Fix usage with specifying local Maven repository

** More complete attempt at re-initialization via

        (ABCL-ASDF:INIT :force t)


Version 1.3.2
=============
http://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.3.2/
19-APR-2015

------------

* Make result of DEFINE-MODIFY-MACRO available at compilation time
  [r14727]

-----
* Fix failed AVER [#289] [r14763]

* Fix incorrect dead code elimination

  Additionally, don't recurse into flet/labels upon elimination of a

* Numeric tower repairs on promoting floats across representation
  boundaries [r14749-50] (Massimiliano Ghilardi).

*  ASDF

** Updated to version 3.1.4.


Version 1.3.1
=============
http://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.3.1/
30-APR-2014

## Fixed

*  The underlying Java Function Interface (JFI) now converts CL:T and
   CL:NIL to JAVA:+TRUE+ and JAVA:+FALSE+.  Users who wish to
   reference a JAVA:+NULL+ should do so explicitly.
   <http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14694>

*  Make JCALL work in more places.  Thanks to Olof-Joachim Frahm.
   <http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14683>

*  Interpolate CL:SLEEP and THREADS:OBJECT-WAIT for timeouts below the
   Planck timer ("1ns") to a nanosecond.
   <http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14679>

*  Update to ASDF 3.1.0.103.
   <http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14661>

   Fixes loading of Ironclad and other Quicklisp systems.

*  Fix Uniform Naming Convention (aka "UNC" or "network") paths under Windows.
   <http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14659>

   DIRECTORY now works again on UNC paths.

   UNC paths may be either specified with either back slash (#\\) or
   forward slash (#\/) doubled as the first character in a Pathname
   namestring.

   The patterns in

        //<server>/<share>/[directories-and-files]

   are parsed as

    <server> is stored as HOST.

    <share> is stored as DEVICE.

    [directories-and-files] gets parsed as per the normal rules under
    Windows.

   Mixing namestrings with both backslash and slash characters can
   lead to unpredictable results.  It is recommended not to use
   backslash characters in namestrings if it can be avoided.  The
   pathname printed representation is always normalized to using
   forward slash delimiters.


*  Find contrib based on system jar name.
   <http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14657>

   From Olof-Joachim Frahm.


Version 1.3.0
=============
http://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.3.0/
15-MAR-2014

## Features

*  Make LispStackFrame.UNAVAILABLE_ARG a singleton object,
   and lazily create the little used portions of the Lisp stack.

    Aggressively cache and control the use of memory by the underlying
    Lisp stack frame representation by introducing the private
    LispThread.StackFrame and LispThread.StackSegments classes.

    Contributed by Dmitry Nadezhin.

    LispStackFrame object are allocated on every
    LispThread.execute(...) .  However, they are seldom [accessed]
    ([... verify via] inspect[tion of the] stack trace). This patch
    delays allocation of LispStackFrame? objects until they are
    requested.  Raw information about stack frames is stored in
    stack. Stack is an Object[] array (more precisely a list of [...]4
    [Mib] Object[] arrays).

    ME: We are going to need a way to try to less agressively grab 4Mib
    chunks in low memory situations.

    Memory profiling of ABCL shows that the classes with largest
    allocation count are org.armedbear.lisp.LispStackFrame and
    org.armedbear.lisp.LispStackFrame.UnavailableArgument.

    Contributed by Dmitry Nadezhin.

    [r14572]: http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14572
    [r14579]: http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14579

*  ASDF 3.0.1.94 shipped with the implementation

*  per function call stack and memory exception handler in CL:COMPILE

   Inline calls to jrun-exception-protected (used by handler-bind to
   catch out of memory conditions).  This commit saves generation
   roughly 50 cls files.

   [r14552]: http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14552

*  SYS:SHA256 audited

    The functionality if the SYS:SHA256 algorithim has been audited for
    use on inputs of single for files with recently shipping ORCL Java 7
    implementations (through jdk-1.7.0_51).

    [r14582]:  http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14582

* Connect to NetBeans controlled JDWP via SLIME

    The Netbeans IDE configuration now includes a way to connect to
    the running-under-jdb ABCL via SLIME.  One needs a version of
    SLIME able to be loaded from its 'swank.asd' definition.  

* Install 'abcl.jar' and 'abcl-contrib.jar' locally as Maven artifacts

    The Ant `abcl.mvn.install` target now installs build artifacts
    into the local Maven repository (Olof-Joachim Frahm)

    [r14579]: http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14606

## Compatibility

*  CL:DIRECTORY 

   The implementation specific :RESOLVE-SYMLINKS argument to the ANSI
   DIRECTORY function has been changed to nil.  This implements
   behavior closer to SBCL and guarantees that a DIRECTORY operation
   will not signal a file error.

   [r14619]: http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14619
   [ticket-340]: http://abcl.org/trac/ticket/340

## Fixes

*  Fix CL:SLEEP for intervals less than a millisecond.  

   For intervals less than or equal to a nanosecond, including an
   interval of zero, the current thread merely yields execution to
   other threads.

   [r14632]: http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14632

## Contrib

#### abcl-asdf

*  Now working with both Maven 3.0.x and 3.1.x.  Thanks to Anton for
   the help!

   [ticket-328]: http://abcl.org/trac/ticket/328

*  cache Maven dependency resolution to avoid repeated lookups.

   Instead of calling ABCL-ASDF:RESOLVE in both the ASDF COMPILE-OP
   and LOAD-OP, we now cache the result of invocation in COMPILE-OP
   and add this value in the LOAD-OP phase. Contributed by Cyrus
   Harmon.

   [r14631]: http://abcl.org/trac/changeset/14631

#### jna
  
   Now references jna-4.0.0.  Some incompatibility with CFFI ([in
   progress with fixing upstream][cffi-easye]).

Version 1.1.0
=============
svn.uri=:"http://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.1.0/abcl/"
(07 December 2012)

Features
--------

  *  A functioning (A)MOP implementation through the hard work of Rudi
     Schlatte (@rudi)

  *  The implementation can be used across many more Quicklisp systems
     through a process of extensive testing.  Thanks @xach!

     Nota bene: all of the following systems need patches to work as
     of the 2012-10-13 Quicklisp.  All patches have been accepted in
     at least an initial form by the upstream maintainers.

     ** CLOSER-MOP 
        Quite possible with local patches 
     ** CFFI 
       Needs patches to 2012-10-13 Quicklisp.  [!!?]
       *** Dynamic interfaces idempotent across process -- no more reloading
     ** HUNCHENTOOT 
       *** some bugs with underlying streams to be fixed in abcl-1.2-dev
     ** CXML
        Basic XML parsing works.  XPath still borked. [???]     
  *  Java 5 bytecode Compiler 

     The internal Lisp-to-Java bytecode compiler has been hardened by
     regression testing across Quicklisp libraries.  

     **  Extensive interpreter/compiler bug fixes due to access to cl-test-suite [???] @antov
     ** large objects (?!?)

  *  The facility to construct runtime classes via JNEW-RUNTIME-CLASS (@astalla)

    Pretty close to full coverage of primtives for creating synthethic
    java classes at runtime.  Easy to extend with your needs; sensible
    defaults.
  
    ** Fields
    *** getter/setters 
    ** Annotations


  * ASDF

     ** Stock ASDF-2.26.6 which includes #+abcl conditional patches
        for the URL-PATHAME and JAR-PATHNAME implementation extensions
        to ANSI.

  *  ABCL-CONTRIB

     ** ABCL-ASDF 

        Network installation of binary artifacts named by Maven POM uris.

        *** checks at runtime if a given class is present in the
            accessible classloaders

        *** If the check for the presence of a class fails, find a
            maven-3.0.4 binary locally, execute its Aether connector
            to retrieve its transitive dependencies from the network.

      ** JSS 
         
         Java Syntax Sucks.  q.v [lsw2]
    
         Extensive bugfixing wrt. method resolution [#229]

      ** JFLI

         A "captured from the wild" version of what @rich.hickey did before Clojure.

Version 1.0.1
==============
svn.uri=:"http://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.0.1/abcl/"
(09 January 2012)

Changes
-------

  * Updated ASDF to 2.019

  * User Manual now contains more polished formating from docstring
    groveling, an index of symbols, and additional enhancements.

  * 'abcl.properties.in' now contains examples of optimizing the ABCL
    wrapper script for 64bit instances for Java7 and for Java6.  

  * [r13720] Randomize string hash computation to guard against
    exploits.

  * [r13723] New internal API in Package.java for looking up internal
    vs. external symbols.

Fixes
-----

  * [#181][r13718] The implementation now correctly loads ASDF definitions
    from jar archives.  This had prevented the ABCL-CONTRIB loading
    mechanism from working.

  * [#177] Made the mechanism for locating the abcl-contrib archive
    more robust

  * [#177] LIST-DIRECTORY no longer ignores :RESOLVE-SYMLINKS

  * [r13706] Fix Streadm.readToken() bug reported by Blake McBride.

Version 1.0.0
==============
svn.uri=:"http://abcl.org/svn/tags/1.0.0/abcl/"
released at the European Common Lisp Meeting Amsterdam 2011
(22 October 2011)


Features
--------

 * (Draft) manual

 * Much better Quicklisp system capabilities (trivial-garbage,
 bordeaux-threads, parenscript, cxml, et. al.)

Changes
-------

 * Updated ASDF to 2.017.22

Fixes
-----

 * CLOSURE-HTML now compiles

 * DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION long form implemented


Version 0.27.0
==============
svn.uri="http://abcl.org/svn/tags/0.27.0/"


Features
--------

 * ABCL works as an SBCL build host

 * Huge (> 64k) literal object support (fixes CL-UNICODE support)

 * The ABCL-ASDF contrib allows the specification of JAR-FILE or
   JAR-DIRECTORY components that can be resolved via a PATHNAME.  The
   MVN component bootstraps a Maven3 Aether connector to locally
   replicate a versioned jar artifact for dynamic inclusion in the
   CLASSPATH.

Changes
-------

 * Renamed LispObject.writeToString() method to (more Lispy) printObject()

 * New LispObject.princToString() for user readable output

 * Changed behaviour of LispObject.unreadableString() to signal
   errors when *PRINT-READABLY* is non-NIL

 * Static initializers moved to <clinit>() (java: static { }) to
   prevent repeated execution when invoking the constructor multiple times

 * Compiler clean-ups

 * Changed implementation of LABELS to eliminate the need
   to *always* create a closure

 * File compiler (COMPILE-FILE) clean-ups

 * When calling a function with the wrong number of arguments,
   report the expected (range) of arguments

 * Upgraded ASDF to 2.017

 * JSS:JLIST-TO-LIST now converts any java.list.List to a Lisp list.

 * The ASDF extensions from JSS for the "jar-directory", "jar-file",
   and "class-file-directory" types have been refactored into the
   ABCL-ASDF contrib as well as the *ADDED-TO-CLASSPATH* variable
   which records dynamically added dependencies.  Use the
   JSS:ENSURE-COMPATIBILITY function to have JSS include these
   dependencies.  

*  As long as ABCL-ASDF:ENSURE-MVN-VERSION can dynamically introspect
   and then load Maven 3 libraries at runtime, ASDF components of type
   MVN can now be used to specify versioned JVM artifacts.

 * Threads spawned by THREADS:MAKE-THREAD can terminate the Lisp image
   via the EXT:QUIT and EXT:EXIT functions.

  DEFUNs for all standard-class slot accessors.
  Note: This addresses the recursive requirement to be able

Changes
-------

* [svn r13141-13146,13156] Make ABCL a well behaving library to better
  support embedding: NEVER call System.exit() again.  Instead, ABCL now
  throws org.armedbear.lisp.ProcessingTerminated and
  org.armedbear.lisp.IntegrityError.

* [svn r13111] Added a "tools" directory available in SVN repository
  to contain tools for developing ABCL in various states.  The first
  inhabitant is 'code-grapher.lisp' that provides a prototype to
  diagram a JVM instruction sequence via graphviz.

* [svn r13101] Reduced verbosity of the AbclScriptEngine.

* [svn r13097-13100] Slight refactoring of PATHNAME code, further

  "jar:URL!/JAR-ENTRY".

  The loading ASDF systems from jar files is now possible.

  SYS:PATHNAME-JAR-P predicate signals whether a pathname references a
  jar.

  NB: jar pathnames do *not* currently work as an argument to OPEN.

  SYS:UNZIP implemented to unpack ZIP files.

  SYS:ZIP now has a three argument version for creating zip files with
  hierarchical entries.

* [svn r12450] Collect unprocessed command-line arguments in
  EXT:*COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENT-LIST* (Dennis Lambe Jr.)

* [svn r12414] SYS::%GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-ARRAY returns a Lisp byte array
  from a Java byte array stream.

* [svn 12402] ABCL.TEST.LISP:RUN-MATCHING will now execute that subset
  of tests which match a string.


Fixes/Optimizations
-------------------

* [svn r12526] Unbinding of PROGV bound variables on local transfer
  of control (within-java-function jump targets)

* [svn r12510] The new ansi-test WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX.23 passes.
  Our with-standard-io-syntax implementation now correctly resets all necessary
  pprint variables. Patch by Douglas R. Miles, thanks for the contribution!

* [svn r12485] Pathnames starting with "." can now have TYPE.

* [svn r12484] FASLs containing "." characters not used to indicate
  type (i.e. ".foo.bar.baz.abcl") can now be loaded.

* [svn r12422] Pathname.java URL contructor under Windows now properly
  interprets the drive letter.

* [svn r12449] The 'abcl.jar' produced by Netbeans now contains a valid
  manifest (found by Paul Griffionen).

* [svn r12441] ZipCache now caches all references to ZipFiles based on
  the last-modified time for local files.  Remote files are always
  retrieved due to problems in the underlying JVM code.

  SYS:REMOVE-ZIP-CACHE implements a way to invalidate an entry given a
  pathname.

* [svn r12439] Remove duplication of java options in Windows
  'abcl.bat' script.

* [svn r12437] CHAR-CODE-LIMIT is the upper execlusive limit (found by
  Paul Griffionen).

* [svn r12436] Describe formatting was missing a newline (reported by
  Blake McBride).

* [svn 12469] Ensure that FILE-ERROR always has a value (possibly NIL)
  for its PATHNAME member.

* [svn r14222] MERGE-PATHNAMES no longer potentially shares structure
  between its result and *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*.

* [svn r12416] Fixed ANSI LAMBDA.nn test failures caused by errors in
  lambda inlining.

* [svn r12417] [ticket:83] Fix TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME regression.
  (Alan Ruttenberg).

* [svn r12412] Optimize memory efficiency of FORMAT by use of a
  hashtable rather than a CHAR-CODE-LIMIT array.

* [svn r12408] FIND-SYMBOL requires a  string argument.

* [svn r12400] Make NIL (as symbol) available to the compiler.

* [svn r12398] Move lambda list analysis to compile time where possible.

* [svn r12397] BROADCAST-STREAM obeys default external format fixing
  ANSI MAKE-BROADCAST-STREAM.8.

* [svn r12395] Improve arglist display for SLIME (Matthias Hölzl).

* [svn r12394] Optimize array utilization in closures.

* [svn r12393] Optimize array functions in compiler which don't
  require clearing the VALUES array.

* [svn r12392] Optimize/normalize aspects of boot.lisp

* [svn r12391] Prevent duplicated subclasses form occuring.


Other
-----

* [svn r12447] SYS::*MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTION* now provides a mechanism
  to extend the REQUIRE resolver mechanism at runtime.

* [svn r12430] Ant based build no longer writes temporary files to
  contain the Lisp build instructions.

* [svn r12481] STANDARD-CLASS now has slots to be inherited by
  deriving metaclasses in support of the (in progress) work on
  metaclass.

* [svn r12425] No longer ignore the METACLASS defclass option in
  support of the (in progress) work on metaclass

* [svn r12422] SYS::*LOAD-TRUENAME-FASL* now contains the TRUENAME of
  the Java "*.cls" component when loading a packed FASL.

* [svn r12461] Human readable Java representations for class cast
  exceptions for NULL and UNBOUND values.

* [svn r12453 et. ff.] Large numbers of the implementation of Java
  primitives have been declared in a way so that a stack trace
  provides a much more readable indication of what has been invoked.
  Primitives which extend Primitive are prefixed with "pf_"; those
  which extend SpecialOperator are prefixed with "sf_".

* [svn r12422] The internal structure of a jar pathname has changed.
  Previously a pathname with a DEVICE that was itself a pathname
  referenced a jar.  This convention was not able to simultaneously
  represent both jar entries that were themselves jar files (as occurs
  with packed FASLs within JARs) and devices which refer to drive
  letters under Windows.  Now, a pathname which refers to a jar has a
  DEVICE which is a proper list of at most two entries.  The first
  entry always references the "outer jar", and the second entry (if it
  exists) references the "inner jar".

* [svn r12419] Ant 'abcl.release' target centralizes the build steps
  necessary for creating releases.

* [svn r12409] Compiler now rewrites function calls with (LAMBDA …) as
  the operator to LET* forms.

* [svn r12415] CLASS-FILE renamed to ABCL-CLASS-FILE to prepare for
  (in progress) reworking of Stream inheritance.

* [svn r123406] 'test/lisp/abcl/bugs.lisp' forms a default location to
  add unit tests for current bug testing.  The intention is to move
  these tests into the proper location elsewhere in the test suite
  once they have been fixed.

* [svn r124040] Java tests upgraded to use junit-4.8.1.  Netbeans
  project runtime classpath now uses compilation results before source
  directory, allowing the invocation of ABCL in interpreted mode if
  the Ant 'abcl.compile.lisp.skip' property is set.  Java unit tests
  for some aspects of jar pathname work added.

*  New toplevel 'doc' directory now contains:

   + [svn r12410] Design for the (in progress) reworking of the Stream
     inheritance.

   + [svn r12433] Design and current status for the re-implementation
     of jar pathnames.

* [svn r12402] Change ABCL unit tests to use the ABCL-TEST-LISP definition
  contained in 'abcl.asd'.  Fixed and renabled math-tests.  Added new
  tests for work related to handling jar pathnames.

* [svn r12401] The REFERENCES-NEEDED-P field of the LOCAL-FUNCTION structure now
  tracks whether local functions need the capture of an actual
  function object.
