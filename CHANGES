Version 0.28.0
==============
(untagged)


Version 0.27.0
==============
svn.uri="http://svn.common-lisp.net/armedbear/tags/0.27.0/"


Features
--------

 * ABCL works as an SBCL build host

 * Huge (> 64k) literal object support (fixes CL-UNICODE support)

 * The ABCL-ASDF contrib allows the specification of JAR-FILE or
   JAR-DIRECTORY components that can be resolved via a PATHNAME.  The
   MVN component bootstraps a Maven3 Aether connector to locally
   replicate a versioned jar artifact for dynamic inclusion in the
   CLASSPATH.

Changes
-------

 * Renamed LispObject.writeToString() method to (more Lispy) printObject()

 * New LispObject.princToString() for user readable output

 * Changed behaviour of LispObject.unreadableString() to signal
   errors when *PRINT-READABLY* is non-NIL

 * Static initializers moved to <clinit>() (java: static { }) to
   prevent repeated execution when invoking the constructor multiple times

 * Compiler clean-ups

 * Changed implementation of LABELS to eliminate the need
   to *always* create a closure

 * File compiler (COMPILE-FILE) clean-ups

 * When calling a function with the wrong number of arguments,
   report the expected (range) of arguments

 * Upgraded ASDF to 2.017

 * JSS:JLIST-TO-LIST now converts any java.list.List to a Lisp list.

 * The ASDF extensions from JSS for the "jar-directory", "jar-file",
   and "class-file-directory" types have been refactored into the
   ABCL-ASDF contrib as well as the *ADDED-TO-CLASSPATH* variable
   which records dynamically added dependencies.  Use the
   JSS:ENSURE-COMPATIBILITY function to have JSS include these
   dependencies.  

*  As long as ABCL-ASDF:ENSURE-MVN-VERSION can dynamically introspect
   and then load Maven 3 libraries at runtime, ASDF components of type
   MVN can now be used to specify versioned JVM artifacts.

 * Threads spawned by THREADS:MAKE-THREAD can terminate the Lisp image
   via the EXT:QUIT and EXT:EXIT functions.

  DEFUNs for all standard-class slot accessors.
  Note: This addresses the recursive requirement to be able

  RandomAccessCharacterFile.  Found and fixed by David Kirkman.


Changes
-------

* [svn r13141-13146,13156] Make ABCL a well behaving library to better
  support embedding: NEVER call System.exit() again.  Instead, ABCL now
  throws org.armedbear.lisp.ProcessingTerminated and
  org.armedbear.lisp.IntegrityError.

* [svn r13111] Added a "tools" directory available in SVN repository
  to contain tools for developing ABCL in various states.  The first
  inhabitant is 'code-grapher.lisp' that provides a prototype to
  diagram a JVM instruction sequence via graphviz.

* [svn r13101] Reduced verbosity of the AbclScriptEngine.

* [svn r13097-13100] Slight refactoring of PATHNAME code, further

Version 0.19
============
svn://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/svn/trunk/abcl
(14 Mar, 2010)

Features
--------

* [svn r12518] *DISASSEMBLER* may now contain a hook which returns the
  command to disassemble compiled functions.

* [svn r12516] An implementation of user-extensible sequences as
  proposed in Christopher Rhodes, "User-extensible sequences in Common
  Lisp", Proc. of the 2007 International Lisp Conference.

* [svn r12513] Implement SYS:SRC and SYS:JAVA logical pathname
  translations for system Lisp source and the root of the Java package
  structure, respectively.

* [svn r12505] All calls to anonymous functions and local functions that have
  been declared inline are now converted to LET* forms, reducing stack usage
  and the number of generated classes.

* [svn r12487] An initial port ASDF-INSTALL now forms the first ABCL
  contrib.  Such contribs are optionally built by the Ant target
  'abcl.contrib'.  ASDF-INSTALL is not expected to work very well
  under Windows in its present state.

* [svn r12447] [ticket:80] REQUIRE now searches for ASDF systems.

* [svn r12422] Jar pathname support extensively re-worked and tested
  so that LOAD, PROBE-FILE, TRUENAME, DIRECTORY, and WRITE-FILE-DATE
  all work both for local and remote jar pathnames of the form
  "jar:URL!/JAR-ENTRY".

  The loading ASDF systems from jar files is now possible.

  SYS:PATHNAME-JAR-P predicate signals whether a pathname references a
  jar.

  NB: jar pathnames do *not* currently work as an argument to OPEN.

  SYS:UNZIP implemented to unpack ZIP files.

  SYS:ZIP now has a three argument version for creating zip files with
  hierarchical entries.

* [svn r12450] Collect unprocessed command-line arguments in
  EXT:*COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENT-LIST* (Dennis Lambe Jr.)

* [svn r12414] SYS::%GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-ARRAY returns a Lisp byte array
  from a Java byte array stream.

* [svn 12402] ABCL.TEST.LISP:RUN-MATCHING will now execute that subset
  of tests which match a string.


Fixes/Optimizations
-------------------

* [svn r12526] Unbinding of PROGV bound variables on local transfer
  of control (within-java-function jump targets)

* [svn r12510] The new ansi-test WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX.23 passes.
  Our with-standard-io-syntax implementation now correctly resets all necessary
  pprint variables. Patch by Douglas R. Miles, thanks for the contribution!

* [svn r12485] Pathnames starting with "." can now have TYPE.

* [svn r12484] FASLs containing "." characters not used to indicate
  type (i.e. ".foo.bar.baz.abcl") can now be loaded.

* [svn r12422] Pathname.java URL contructor under Windows now properly
  interprets the drive letter.

* [svn r12449] The 'abcl.jar' produced by Netbeans now contains a valid
  manifest (found by Paul Griffionen).

* [svn r12441] ZipCache now caches all references to ZipFiles based on
  the last-modified time for local files.  Remote files are always
  retrieved due to problems in the underlying JVM code.

  SYS:REMOVE-ZIP-CACHE implements a way to invalidate an entry given a
  pathname.

* [svn r12439] Remove duplication of java options in Windows
  'abcl.bat' script.

* [svn r12437] CHAR-CODE-LIMIT is the upper execlusive limit (found by
  Paul Griffionen).

* [svn r12436] Describe formatting was missing a newline (reported by
  Blake McBride).

* [svn 12469] Ensure that FILE-ERROR always has a value (possibly NIL)
  for its PATHNAME member.

* [svn r14222] MERGE-PATHNAMES no longer potentially shares structure
  between its result and *DEFAULT-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS*.

* [svn r12416] Fixed ANSI LAMBDA.nn test failures caused by errors in
  lambda inlining.

* [svn r12417] [ticket:83] Fix TRANSLATE-LOGICAL-PATHNAME regression.
  (Alan Ruttenberg).

* [svn r12412] Optimize memory efficiency of FORMAT by use of a
  hashtable rather than a CHAR-CODE-LIMIT array.

* [svn r12408] FIND-SYMBOL requires a  string argument.

* [svn r12400] Make NIL (as symbol) available to the compiler.

* [svn r12398] Move lambda list analysis to compile time where possible.

* [svn r12397] BROADCAST-STREAM obeys default external format fixing
  ANSI MAKE-BROADCAST-STREAM.8.

* [svn r12395] Improve arglist display for SLIME (Matthias Hölzl).

* [svn r12394] Optimize array utilization in closures.

* [svn r12393] Optimize array functions in compiler which don't
  require clearing the VALUES array.

* [svn r12392] Optimize/normalize aspects of boot.lisp

* [svn r12391] Prevent duplicated subclasses form occuring.


Other
-----

* [svn r12447] SYS::*MODULE-PROVIDER-FUNCTION* now provides a mechanism
  to extend the REQUIRE resolver mechanism at runtime.

* [svn r12430] Ant based build no longer writes temporary files to
  contain the Lisp build instructions.

* [svn r12481] STANDARD-CLASS now has slots to be inherited by
  deriving metaclasses in support of the (in progress) work on
  metaclass.

* [svn r12425] No longer ignore the METACLASS defclass option in
  support of the (in progress) work on metaclass

* [svn r12422] SYS::*LOAD-TRUENAME-FASL* now contains the TRUENAME of
  the Java "*.cls" component when loading a packed FASL.

* [svn r12461] Human readable Java representations for class cast
  exceptions for NULL and UNBOUND values.

* [svn r12453 et. ff.] Large numbers of the implementation of Java
  primitives have been declared in a way so that a stack trace
  provides a much more readable indication of what has been invoked.
  Primitives which extend Primitive are prefixed with "pf_"; those
  which extend SpecialOperator are prefixed with "sf_".

* [svn r12422] The internal structure of a jar pathname has changed.
  Previously a pathname with a DEVICE that was itself a pathname
  referenced a jar.  This convention was not able to simultaneously
  represent both jar entries that were themselves jar files (as occurs
  with packed FASLs within JARs) and devices which refer to drive
  letters under Windows.  Now, a pathname which refers to a jar has a
  DEVICE which is a proper list of at most two entries.  The first
  entry always references the "outer jar", and the second entry (if it
  exists) references the "inner jar".

* [svn r12419] Ant 'abcl.release' target centralizes the build steps
  necessary for creating releases.

* [svn r12409] Compiler now rewrites function calls with (LAMBDA …) as
  the operator to LET* forms.

* [svn r12415] CLASS-FILE renamed to ABCL-CLASS-FILE to prepare for
  (in progress) reworking of Stream inheritance.

* [svn r123406] 'test/lisp/abcl/bugs.lisp' forms a default location to
  add unit tests for current bug testing.  The intention is to move
  these tests into the proper location elsewhere in the test suite
  once they have been fixed.

* [svn r124040] Java tests upgraded to use junit-4.8.1.  Netbeans
  project runtime classpath now uses compilation results before source
  directory, allowing the invocation of ABCL in interpreted mode if
  the Ant 'abcl.compile.lisp.skip' property is set.  Java unit tests
  for some aspects of jar pathname work added.

*  New toplevel 'doc' directory now contains:

   + [svn r12410] Design for the (in progress) reworking of the Stream
     inheritance.

   + [svn r12433] Design and current status for the re-implementation
     of jar pathnames.

* [svn r12402] Change ABCL unit tests to use the ABCL-TEST-LISP definition
  contained in 'abcl.asd'.  Fixed and renabled math-tests.  Added new
  tests for work related to handling jar pathnames.

* [svn r12401] The REFERENCES-NEEDED-P field of the LOCAL-FUNCTION structure now
  tracks whether local functions need the capture of an actual
  function object.
