Version 0.16.0
(unreleased)

  Summary of changes:
  * Better initarg checking for make-instance and change-class. Fixes ansi-test
    errors CHANGE-CLASS.1.11, MAKE-INSTANCE.ERROR.3, MAKE-INSTANCE.ERROR.4,
    CHANGE-CLASS.ERROR.4 and SHARED-INITIALIZE.ERROR.4.
  * Improve performance of StackFrames (Erik Huelsmann, Ville Voutilainen,
    with input from Peter Graves and Douglas Miles)
  * Improve performance of CLOS eql-specializers via cache (Anton Vodonosov).
  * 'build-from-lisp.sh' shell script (Tobias Rittweiler).
  * New threading primitives aligned with Java/JVM constructs (Erik Huelsmann)

      SYNCHRONIZED-ON
      OBJECT-NOTIFY
      OBJECT-NOTIFY-ALL

  * THREADS package created to hold threads related primitives:	

      THREADP THREAD-UNLOCK THREAD-LOCK THREAD-NAME THREAD-ALIVE-P
      CURRENT-THREAD DESTROY-THREAD INTERRUPT-THREAD WITH-THREAD-LOCK
      MAKE-THREAD-LOCK MAKE-THREAD INTERRUPT-THREAD

      MAPCAR-THREADS
      
      GET-MUTEX MAKE-MUTEX WITH-MUTEX RELEASE-MUTEX

    These primitives are still part of the EXTENSIONS package but are
    now to be considered as deprecated, marked to be removed with
    0.22.

Version 0.14.1
(5 Apr, 2009)
svn://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/svn/tags/0.14.1/abcl

 Summary of changes:
  * Include this CHANGES file and scripting files in the tar and zip files


Version 0.14.0
(5 Apr, 2009)
svn://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/svn/tags/0.14.0/abcl

 Summary of changes:
  * Increased clarity on licensing (Classpath exception
     mentioned in COPYING, removed LICENSE)
  * Resolved infinite recursion on TRACEing the compiler
  * Changes on the lisp based build system for parity with Ant
  * Fixed interpreter creation in Java Scripting
  * libabcl.so no longer created; it was solely about installing
     a SIGINT handler. Libraries should not do that.
  * boxing of LispObject descendants in JCALL/JCALL-RAW fixed
  * OpenBSD and NetBSD platform detection
  * fixed special bindings restores in compiled code for
     MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND/LET/LET*/PROGV and function bodies
  * introduced variadic list() function to replace list1() ... list9()
  * fix return value type of ACOS with complex argument
  * fixed precision of multiplication of complex values
  * fixed use of COMPILE inside file compilation (i.e. COMPILE-FILE)
  * fix expansion of macros inside RESTART-CASE
     (fixes RESTART-CASE ANSI failures)
  * fix macroexpansion in the precompiler
  * Fixnum and Bignum now use a static factory method;
      constructors are now private -> increases chances of numbers
      being EQ
  * Code cleanup in EXPT to fix (EXPT <any-number> <Bignum>)


Version 0.13.0
(28 Feb, 2009)
svn://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/svn/tags/0.13.0/abcl

 Summary of changes:
  * Separated J and ABCL into two trees
  * Many many compiler code cleanups
  * NetBeans project files
  * Support for CDR6 (See http://cdr.eurolisp.org/document/6/)
  * More efficient code emission in the compiler
  * Ant build targets for testing (abcl.test)
  * Use ConcurrentHashMap to store the lisp threads for increased performance
  * Fix adjustability of expressly adjustable arrays (ticket #28)
  * Fix calculation of upperbound on ASH in the compiler
     (don't calculate numbers too big, instead, return '*')
  * Introduce LispInteger as the super type of Bignum and Fixnum
  * Boxing/unboxing for SingleFloat and DoubleFloat values,
      inclusive of unboxed calculations
  * Fixed URL decoding bug in loadCompiledFunction (use java.net.URLDecoder)
  * Fixed line number counting
  * Inlining of simple calculations (+/-/*)
  * All static fields declared 'final'
  * Add support for java.lang.Long based on Bignum to our FFI
