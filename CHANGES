Version 0.14.0
(?? Apr, 2009)
svn://common-lisp.net/project/armedbear/svn/tags/0.14.0/abcl

 Summary of changes:
  * Increased clarity on licensing (Classpath exception
     mentioned in COPYING, removed LICENSE)
  * Resolved infinite recursion on TRACEing the compiler
  * Changes on the lisp based build system for parity with Ant
  * Fixed interpreter creation in Java Scripting
  * libabcl.so no longer created; it was solely about installing
     a SIGINT handler. Libraries should not do that.
  * boxing of LispObject descendants in JCALL/JCALL-RAW fixed
  * OpenBSD and NetBSD platform detection
  * fixed special bindings restores in compiled code for
     MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND/LET/LET*/PROGV and function bodies
  * introduced variadic list() function to replace list1() ... list9()
  * fix return value type of ACOS with complex argument
  * fixed precision of multiplication of complex values
  * fixed use of COMPILE inside file compilation (i.e. COMPILE-FILE)
  * fix expansion of macros inside RESTART-CASE
     (fixes RESTART-CASE ANSI failures)
  * fix macroexpansion in the precompiler
  * Fixnum and Bignum now use a static factory method;
      constructors are now private -> increases chances of numbers
      being EQ

  * Use ConcurrentHashMap to store the lisp threads for increased performance
  * Fix adjustability of expressly adjustable arrays (ticket #28)
  * Fix calculation of upperbound on ASH in the compiler
     (don't calculate numbers too big, instead, return '*')
  * Introduce LispInteger as the super type of Bignum and Fixnum
  * Boxing/unboxing for SingleFloat and DoubleFloat values,
      inclusive of unboxed calculations
  * Fixed URL decoding bug in loadCompiledFunction (use java.net.URLDecoder)
