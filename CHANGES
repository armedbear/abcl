  Summary of changes:
  ------------------
  * Fixed generated wrapper for path names with spaces (Windows)
  * Fixed ticket #58: Inspection of Java objects in Lisp code
  * Restored functionality of the built-in profiler
  * Profiler extended with hot-spot counting (as opposed to call counting)
  * Stack sampling in the profiler moved to scheduler thread to
    reduce impact on the program execution thread
  * THE type-checking for the interpreter
    (for simple-enough type specifications)
  * Added structure argument type checking in structure slot
    accessor functions
  * Make GENSYM thread-safe
  * Various performance fixes found by running the raytracer
    from http://www.ffconsultancy.com/languages/ray_tracer/benchmark.html
  * Better initarg checking for make-instance and change-class
    Fixes ansi-test errors CHANGE-CLASS.1.11, MAKE-INSTANCE.ERROR.3,
    MAKE-INSTANCE.ERROR.4, CHANGE-CLASS.ERROR.4 and SHARED-INITIALIZE.ERROR.4
  * Improve performance of StackFrames (Erik Huelsmann, Ville Voutilainen,
    with input from Peter Graves and Douglas Miles)
  * Improve performance of CLOS eql-specializers via cache (Anton Vodonosov)
  * 'build-from-lisp.sh' shell script (Tobias Rittweiler)
  * New threading primitives aligned with Java/JVM constructs (Erik Huelsmann)

      SYNCHRONIZED-ON
      OBJECT-NOTIFY

  * THREADS package created to hold threads related primitives:

      THREADP THREAD-UNLOCK THREAD-LOCK THREAD-NAME THREAD-ALIVE-P

    These primitives are still part of the EXTENSIONS package but are
    now to be considered as deprecated, marked to be removed with
    0.22
  * Stacktraces now contain calls through Java code relevant to
    debugging (Tobias Rittweiler)

    Backtrace functionality been moved from EXT:BACKTRACE-AS-LIST to
    SYS:BACKTRACE to mark this changes.  The methods SYS:FRAME-TO-STRING
    and SYS:FRAME-TO-LIST can be used to inspect the new
    LISP_STACK_FRAME and JAVA_STACK_FRAME objects
  * Various stream input performance optimizations
  * Fixed breakage when combining Gray streams and the pretty printer
  * Performance improvements for resolution of non-recursive #=n and #n#

 Summary of changes:
 -------------------
  * Increased clarity on licensing (Classpath exception
     mentioned in COPYING, removed LICENSE)
  * Resolved infinite recursion on TRACEing the compiler
  * Changes on the lisp based build system for parity with Ant
  * Fixed interpreter creation in Java Scripting
  * libabcl.so no longer created; it was solely about installing
     a SIGINT handler. Libraries should not do that.
  * boxing of LispObject descendants in JCALL/JCALL-RAW fixed
  * OpenBSD and NetBSD platform detection
  * fixed special bindings restores in compiled code for
     MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND/LET/LET*/PROGV and function bodies

  * fixed use of COMPILE inside file compilation (i.e. COMPILE-FILE)
  * fix expansion of macros inside RESTART-CASE
     (fixes RESTART-CASE ANSI failures)
  * fix macroexpansion in the precompiler
  * Fixnum and Bignum now use a static factory method;
      constructors are now private -> increases chances of numbers
      being EQ
  * Code cleanup in EXPT to fix (EXPT <any-number> <Bignum>)

  * Introduce LispInteger as the super type of Bignum and Fixnum
  * Boxing/unboxing for SingleFloat and DoubleFloat values,
      inclusive of unboxed calculations
  * Fixed URL decoding bug in loadCompiledFunction (use java.net.URLDecoder)
