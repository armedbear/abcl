  "Run PROGRAM with ARGS in with ENVIRONMENT variables.

Possibly WAIT for subprocess to exit.

Optionally CLEAR-ENVIRONMENT of the subprocess of any non specified values.

Creates a new process running the the PROGRAM.

ARGS are a list of strings to be passed to the program as arguments.

For no arguments, use nil which means that just the name of the
program is passed as arg 0.

Returns a process structure containing the JAVA-OBJECT wrapped Process
object, and the PROCESS-INPUT, PROCESS-OUTPUT, and PROCESS-ERROR streams.

Notes about Unix environments (as in the :environment):

    * The ABCL implementation of run-program, like SBCL, Perl and many
      other programs, copies the Unix environment by default.

    * Running Unix programs from a setuid process, or in any other
      situation where the Unix environment is under the control of
      someone else, is a mother lode of security problems. If you are
      contemplating doing this, read about it first. (The Perl
      community has a lot of good documentation about this and other
      security issues in script-like programs.

The &key arguments have the following meanings:

:environment
    An alist of STRINGs (name . value) describing new
    environment values that replace existing ones.

:clear-environment
    If non-NIL, the current environment is cleared before the
    values supplied by :environment are inserted.

:wait
    If non-NIL, which is the default, wait until the created process
    finishes. If NIL, continue running Lisp until the program
    finishes.

:input
    If T, I/O is inherited from the Java process. If NIL, /dev/null is used
    (nul on Windows). If a PATHNAME designator other than a stream is
    supplied, input will be read from that file. If set to :STREAM, a stream
    will be available via PROCESS-INPUT to read from. Defaults to :STREAM.

:if-input-does-not-exist
    If :input points to a non-existing file, this may be set to :ERROR in
    order to signal an error, :CREATE to create and read from an empty file,
    or NIL to immediately NIL instead of creating the process.
    Defaults to NIL.

:output
    If T, I/O is inherited from the Java process. If NIL, /dev/null is used
    (nul on Windows). If a PATHNAME designator other than a stream is
    supplied, output will be redirect to that file. If set to :STREAM, a
    stream will be available via PROCESS-OUTPUT to write to.
    Defaults to :STREAM.

:if-output-exists
    If :output points to a non-existing file, this may be set to :ERROR in
    order to signal an error, :SUPERSEDE to supersede the existing file,
    :APPEND to append to it instead, or NIL to immediately NIL instead of
    creating the process. Defaults to :ERROR.

:error
    Same as :output, but can also be :output, in which case the error stream
    is redirected to wherever the standard output stream goes.
    Defaults to :STREAM.

:if-error-exists
    Same as :if-output-exists, but for the :error target.

:directory
    If set will become the working directory for the new process, otherwise
    the working directory will be unchanged from the current Java process.
    Defaults to NIL.
