;;;; See <file:GrayStream.java> for the Java proxy that calls into
;;;; these methods.

;;;; N.b. The function symbols seemingly have to be unique across all
;;;; packages for this to work, hence the "java/â€¦" prefixes.
;;;;
;;;; A possible optimization would be able to make these calls
;;;; directly from GrayStream.java, but since a majority of the
;;;; generic method machinery gets redfined/augmented Lisp side via
;;;; clos.lisp this probably won't be particularly easy.
