;;;; This code was modified by William Harold Newman beginning

;;;; system and then subsequently to address other cross-compiling
;;;; bootstrap issues, SBCLification (e.g. DECLARE used to check
;;;; argument types), and other maintenance. Whether or not it then
;;;; supported all the environments implied by the reader conditionals
;;;; in the source code (e.g. #!+CLOE-RUNTIME) before that
;;;; modification, it sure doesn't now. It might perhaps, by blind
;;;; luck, be appropriate for some other CMU-CL-derived system, but

(in-package "LOOP")

;;;; The design of this LOOP is intended to permit, using mostly the same
;;;; kernel of code, up to three different "loop" macros:
;;;;
;;;; (1) The unextended, unextensible ANSI standard LOOP;
;;;;
;;;; (2) A clean "superset" extension of the ANSI LOOP which provides
;;;; functionality similar to that of the old LOOP, but "in the style of"
;;;; the ANSI LOOP. For instance, user-definable iteration paths, with a
;;;; somewhat cleaned-up interface.
;;;;
;;;; (3) Extensions provided in another file which can make this LOOP
;;;; kernel behave largely compatibly with the Genera-vintage LOOP macro,
;;;; with only a small addition of code (instead of two whole, separate,
;;;; LOOP macros).
;;;;
;;;; Each of the above three LOOP variations can coexist in the same LISP
;;;; environment.
;;;;
;;;; KLUDGE: In SBCL, we only really use variant (1), and any generality
;;;; for the other variants is wasted. -- WHN 20000121

;;;; FIXME: the STEP-FUNCTION stuff in the code seems to've been
;;;; intended to support code which was conditionalized with
;;;; LOOP-PREFER-POP (not true on CMU CL) and which has since been
;;;; removed. Thus, STEP-FUNCTION stuff could probably be removed too.

;;;; maximization technology

#|
The basic idea of all this minimax randomness here is that we have to
have constructed all uses of maximize and minimize to a particular
"destination" before we can decide how to code them. The goal is to not
have to have any kinds of flags, by knowing both that (1) the type is
something which we can provide an initial minimum or maximum value for
and (2) know that a MAXIMIZE and MINIMIZE are not being combined.

SO, we have a datastructure which we annotate with all sorts of things,
incrementally updating it as we generate loop body code, and then use
a wrapper and internal macros to do the coding when the loop has been
constructed.

;;;; LOOP keyword tables

#|
LOOP keyword tables are hash tables string keys and a test of EQUAL.

The actual descriptive/dispatch structure used by LOOP is called a "loop
universe" contains a few tables and parameterizations. The basic idea is
that we can provide a non-extensible ANSI-compatible loop environment,
an extensible ANSI-superset loop environment, and (for such environments
as CLOE) one which is "sufficiently close" to the old Genera-vintage
LOOP for use by old user programs without requiring all of the old LOOP
code to be loaded.
