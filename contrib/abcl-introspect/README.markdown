ABCL-INTROSPECT
===============

ABCL-INTROSPECT offers more extensive systems for inspecting the state
of the implementation, most notably in integration with SLIME, where
the back-trace mechanism is augmented to the point that local
variables are inspectable.

See <https://github.com/easye/slime/tree/evenson-merge-20170529a> for
the changes to SLIME that were working well at the time of release.
